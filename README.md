# EnergyDomainOntologies

This repository hosts a collection of OWL ontologies for the energy sector. These ontologies aim to support the digital representation, integration, and interoperability of data across multiple domains and disciplines within energy-related projects.

Each ontology is organised according to its sector (e.g. Oil and Gas, Renewables, Power Grids) and its technical discipline (e.g. Flexible Pipes, Subsea Control Systems).
